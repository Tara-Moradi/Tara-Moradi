## Hi there ğŸ‘‹



Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on energy-efficient nanophotonic deep
learning
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Machine learning

- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Quantum optics, quantum, and optics
  
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: tmordai@gmail.com

- ğŸ–¥ Skills:

- Photonics and Optics

- Research and Development (R&D)

- Data Analysis (SQL and python)

- DWDM

- Comsol, python, Mathematica, Matlab, SQL, ...
