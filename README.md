## Hi there ðŸ‘‹



Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on energy-efficient nanophotonic deep learning
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Machine learning

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Quantum optics, quantum, and optics
  
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: tmordai@gmail.com
  

  ðŸ–¥ My Skills:

- Photonics, Optics, and Nonlinear Optics

- Research and Development (R&D)

- Data Analysis (SQL and python)

- DWDM, Plasmonics, Thin Film Deposition, Cleanroom, Nanofabrication, phase change materials, Troubleshooting, ...

- Comsol, python, Mathematica, Matlab, SQL, Latex, Simulations, SOLIDWORKS, ...
